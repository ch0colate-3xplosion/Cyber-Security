## ProxKube - Proxmox VM Converter
This repository was pulled from: https://github.com/Ap3x/ProxKube

Ap3x "I made this project while I was studying for my OSCP and wanted a way to upload a large number of VulnHub virtual machines to my ProxMox host and deploy all the machines appropriately."

The Project under VulnHub-Proxmox-Setup is something I made for Proxmox Server to setup Vulnhub. It downloads 7z, zip, bz2, tar, gz, tgz extracts the files, then will convert the ova, vmdk, vdi, to Proxmox qcow2.
